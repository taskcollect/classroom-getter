VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

“I wish I could tell you about the South Pacific. The way it actually was. The endless ocean. The infinite specks of coral we called islands. Coconut palms nodding gracefully toward the ocean. Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Hi all. This task sheet is here in case you want to reference it in the lead-up to the learner conference.

Please allow yourself 80 minutes to do the test.
I would appreciate that this is somewhat supervised by a parent/caregiver or a relative such as a grandparent.
It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Hi all. This task sheet is here in case you want to reference it in the lead-up to the learner conference.

To do this, you'd need to connect the learner conference goals to the chosen capabilities, then provide evidence of - and insightful observations on - your use of those capabilities.

The 2 edpuzzle clips covering 1914 and 1918 will provide you with an excellent overview of the course of the war and fast track your knowledge of the conflict. This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

“I wish I could tell you about the South Pacific. The way it actually was. The endless ocean. The infinite specks of coral we called islands. Coconut palms nodding gracefully toward the ocean. Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Thermal Physics Test 2020
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTIxMTU2MTI3NTda/a/NTYwNzM4MDQ3MzRa/details

Please allow yourself 80 minutes to do the test.
I would appreciate that this is somewhat supervised by a parent/caregiver or a relative such as a grandparent.
It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Leadership Growth
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5Njg4/a/Mzg2MTEyMDExNzEy/details

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

The 2 edpuzzle clips covering 1914 and 1918 will provide you with an excellent overview of the course of the war and fast track your knowledge of the conflict. This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.


NOTE: I've uploaded my sample code to assist you - if you need some help getting started.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Thermal Physics Test 2020
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTIxMTU2MTI3NTda/a/NTYwNzM4MDQ3MzRa/details

Please allow yourself 80 minutes to do the test.
I would appreciate that this is somewhat supervised by a parent/caregiver or a relative such as a grandparent.
It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.


NOTE: I've uploaded my sample code to assist you - if you need some help getting started.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Leadership Growth
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5Njg4/a/Mzg2MTEyMDExNzEy/details

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Over the weekend I would like you to view the Edpuzzle clip on the last year of the war and respond to the embedded questions. 

The 2 edpuzzle clips covering 1914 and 1918 will provide you with an excellent overview of the course of the war and fast track your knowledge of the conflict. This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

I hope this famous quote from the novel "South Pacific" sets the scene for you?

Please use the attached Google Doc to develop your list of "Rights" and "Rules" which will allow your island to function as a safe and fair community.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Hi all. This task sheet is here in case you want to reference it in the lead-up to the learner conference. Remember, there is no need to do anything with it yet, but if you'd like you could try dedicate five minutes  of your learner conference to two of the seven capabilities (see the other classroom post; two-and-a-half minutes per chosen capability). To do this, you'd need to connect the learner conference goals to the chosen capabilities, then provide evidence of - and insightful observations on - your use of those capabilities.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Upload the reflection you wrote on Year-8-You here, and then explain how you're different today, highlighting key achievements along the way that may have contributed to this difference (eg participation in clubs and leadership, making friends, participating in various sporting things, things you've done outside of school etc).


Then, write about what you'd like 'Senior-School-You' to look like. Think about things that person will do, or will have done (what will you look like as a friend, 'child', member of society, Captain, Peer Support Leader, Successful Completer of IB/SACE, Ready-for-Uni/Work person,) and how those things may contribute to your evolution and growth.

I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Thermal Physics Test 2020
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTIxMTU2MTI3NTda/a/NTYwNzM4MDQ3MzRa/details

Please allow yourself 80 minutes to do the test.
I would appreciate that this is somewhat supervised by a parent/caregiver or a relative such as a grandparent.
It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

“I wish I could tell you about the South Pacific. The way it actually was. The endless ocean. The infinite specks of coral we called islands. Coconut palms nodding gracefully toward the ocean. Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

The 2 edpuzzle clips covering 1914 and 1918 will provide you with an excellent overview of the course of the war and fast track your knowledge of the conflict. This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.


NOTE: I've uploaded my sample code to assist you - if you need some help getting started.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.


NOTE: I've uploaded my sample code to assist you - if you need some help getting started.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Edpuzzle World War One - 1918 (End of the War)
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTA1MzE4NjgyMzZa/a/NjA5MzQ2NjkwMzRa/details

Over the weekend I would like you to view the Edpuzzle clip on the last year of the war and respond to the embedded questions. 

The 2 edpuzzle clips covering 1914 and 1918 will provide you with an excellent overview of the course of the war and fast track your knowledge of the conflict. This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Hi all. This task sheet is here in case you want to reference it in the lead-up to the learner conference. Remember, there is no need to do anything with it yet, but if you'd like you could try dedicate five minutes  of your learner conference to two of the seven capabilities (see the other classroom post; two-and-a-half minutes per chosen capability). To do this, you'd need to connect the learner conference goals to the chosen capabilities, then provide evidence of - and insightful observations on - your use of those capabilities.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Edpuzzle World War One - 1918 (End of the War)
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTA1MzE4NjgyMzZa/a/NjA5MzQ2NjkwMzRa/details

Over the weekend I would like you to view the Edpuzzle clip on the last year of the war and respond to the embedded questions. 

The 2 edpuzzle clips covering 1914 and 1918 will provide you with an excellent overview of the course of the war and fast track your knowledge of the conflict. This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

Task F: Danger Island
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTA1MzE4NjgyMzZa/a/ODIyMTcxNTAzMjha/details

“I wish I could tell you about the South Pacific. The way it actually was. The endless ocean. The infinite specks of coral we called islands. Coconut palms nodding gracefully toward the ocean. Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

I hope this famous quote from the novel "South Pacific" sets the scene for you?

Please use the attached Google Doc to develop your list of "Rights" and "Rules" which will allow your island to function as a safe and fair community.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Hi all. This task sheet is here in case you want to reference it in the lead-up to the learner conference. Remember, there is no need to do anything with it yet, but if you'd like you could try dedicate five minutes  of your learner conference to two of the seven capabilities (see the other classroom post; two-and-a-half minutes per chosen capability). To do this, you'd need to connect the learner conference goals to the chosen capabilities, then provide evidence of - and insightful observations on - your use of those capabilities.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.


NOTE: I've uploaded my sample code to assist you - if you need some help getting started.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Leadership Growth
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5Njg4/a/Mzg2MTEyMDExNzEy/details

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Hi all. This task sheet is here in case you want to reference it in the lead-up to the learner conference. Remember, there is no need to do anything with it yet, but if you'd like you could try dedicate five minutes  of your learner conference to two of the seven capabilities (see the other classroom post; two-and-a-half minutes per chosen capability). To do this, you'd need to connect the learner conference goals to the chosen capabilities, then provide evidence of - and insightful observations on - your use of those capabilities.

This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Please allow yourself 80 minutes to do the test.
I would appreciate that this is somewhat supervised by a parent/caregiver or a relative such as a grandparent.
It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

To demonstrate you've been working on developing your ability to minimise procrastination, create a record of how you used to view procrastination, what the attached resources have done to your understanding of procrastination, and evidence where you've been experimenting with using these new understandings to minimise procrastination.


This may look like an initial statement, followed by a photo of your notes, a follow-up statement explaining what you've learned from the resources and how you're going to action that, then evidence of you implementing those actions.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Thermal Physics Test 2020
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTIxMTU2MTI3NTda/a/NTYwNzM4MDQ3MzRa/details

Please allow yourself 80 minutes to do the test.
I would appreciate that this is somewhat supervised by a parent/caregiver or a relative such as a grandparent.
It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

Hi all. This task sheet is here in case you want to reference it in the lead-up to the learner conference. Remember, there is no need to do anything with it yet, but if you'd like you could try dedicate five minutes  of your learner conference to two of the seven capabilities (see the other classroom post; two-and-a-half minutes per chosen capability). To do this, you'd need to connect the learner conference goals to the chosen capabilities, then provide evidence of - and insightful observations on - your use of those capabilities.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.


NOTE: I've uploaded my sample code to assist you - if you need some help getting started.

Please allow yourself 80 minutes to do the test.
I would appreciate that this is somewhat supervised by a parent/caregiver or a relative such as a grandparent.
It is open book.
I will not want to see cloned cut copy and paste answers - such will get zero for the question.
Note; Even incorrect answers can be awarded very good marks if the reasoning behind them is logical and consistent.
Good luck with it.

Over the weekend I would like you to view the Edpuzzle clip on the last year of the war and respond to the embedded questions. 

The 2 edpuzzle clips covering 1914 and 1918 will provide you with an excellent overview of the course of the war and fast track your knowledge of the conflict. This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.”

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.

I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Task F: Danger Island
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTA1MzE4NjgyMzZa/a/ODIyMTcxNTAzMjha/details

“I wish I could tell you about the South Pacific. The way it actually was. The endless ocean. The infinite specks of coral we called islands. Coconut palms nodding gracefully toward the ocean. Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

I hope this famous quote from the novel "South Pacific" sets the scene for you?

Please use the attached Google Doc to develop your list of "Rights" and "Rules" which will allow your island to function as a safe and fair community.

Skill Development: Creativity
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/MzM4OTEzNTcxMzA4/details

Last year you watched John Cleese give a speech about creativity. In it, he provided plenty of information - some of it anecdotal, some of it based in research - about the creative process. You also had several opportunities to be creative, and spent some time looking at several examples of how one of his suggetions - to create 'intermediate impossibles' - could be used to create new critical awareness.


Use the attached video link, highlighted script, and - if you want - the note-taking scaffold to synthesis Cleese's thinking, then reflect on the extent to which it's been useful for your creative process.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess
again”, if the guess it too low, it should print the message “Too low! Guess
again”, and if the guess is equal it
should print the message “That’s the number! Click the first button to play
again!”.


NOTE: I've uploaded my sample code to assist you - if you need some help getting started.

It is open book.

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

Remember, there is no need to do anything with it yet, but if you'd like you could try dedicate five minutes  of your learner conference to two of the seven capabilities (see the other classroom post; two-and-a-half minutes per chosen capability). To do this, you'd need to connect the learner conference goals to the chosen capabilities, then provide evidence of - and insightful observations on - your use of those capabilities.

Task F: Danger Island
https://classroom.google.com/c/NTA1MzE4NjgyMzZa/a/ODIyMTcxNTAzMjha/details

“I wish I could tell you about the South Pacific. The way it actually was. The endless ocean. The infinite specks of coral we called islands. Coconut palms nodding gracefully toward the ocean. Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

I hope this famous quote from the novel "South Pacific" sets the scene for you?

Please use the attached Google Doc to develop your list of "Rights" and "Rules" which will allow your island to function as a safe and fair community.

Leadership Growth
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5Njg4/a/Mzg2MTEyMDExNzEy/details

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.

This will provide the big picture so we can move onto the new technology section and understand why new weapons were so important for each side as they tried to gain an advantage which might break the seemingly endless stalemate of the Western Front.

Reefs upon which waves broke into spray, and inner lagoons, lovely beyond description. I wish I could tell you about the sweating jungle, the full moon rising behind the volcanoes, and the waiting. The waiting. The timeless, repetitive waiting.” 
― James A. Michener, Tales of the South Pacific (1947)

Mr Barrett's Example Task 1
https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ2ODUwNjI5NzA4/a/Mjg2MjQ0NjM5NzUw/details

I thought it might be useful for some if I gave a rundown on the process I would use to create 'task one' for the PLP.

Step 1: Choose two capabilities I think I understand, and can exemplify

Step 2: Identify three examples of things I've done that demonstrate my capability in those areas (in this case, those three things 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲).

Step 3: Start writing down what my understanding of those capabilities is, linking any material that supports my beliefs (eg, John Cleese's view on creativity, or the competing sets of data I read in trying to think critically about something)

Step 4: Connect these understandings to the things I've done, creating links to those pieces of evidence (these could be docs, photos, journals, film etc)

Step 5: Provide as much insight into why these are indeed examples of my chosen capabilities (essentially, trying to prove myself)

Attached is the work in progress, which I'll try yo update in the coming days.

VueJS Skills 1: Guess the number
https://classroom.google.com/c/MzcyODMxNTUwODAx/a/Mzg1ODk5NDA5ODYy/details

Remember the simple Python application that
generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number?


Let us try it with VueJS...


Create a web application with a text input,
two buttons and message text.


Button one: generates a random number and
saves it in a variable.


Button two: takes user input (from text input)
and checks if the user’s guess is correct. 
If the guess is too high, it should print the message “Too high! Guess

Leadership Growth

As I explained in Wk 6, I predict you will be asked to include a short reflection on your growth as a leader in your time at GIHS. I may be wrong, but on the off-chance I'm not, let's begin those reflections in our leadership sessions (of course, they could well be really quite genuine and worthwhile reflections for many of you too!).


Upload a Google Doc here, and begin by reflecting on what your initial group brainstorm about leadership at GIHS, and your identification of effective 'real world' leaders, got you thinking about leadership. Where possible, make connections to what you do, or aspire to do, as a leader.
